# Feature Selection with Lending Club Dataset

One of the most relevant topics in machine learning is identifying which features or attributes to use in your models. In most real world problems, data often has many features but only few are related to the target we are interested in. Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of features which are then used in model construction.

We are going to look at data from a popular lending marketplace Lending Club. In this end to end example we're going to be examining different attributes that lending club collects from borrowers and how they influence the interest rates. The dataset contains loan applications from 2007 through 2018 with current loan status and payment information.

Our example dataset has 150 columns containing both categorical and continuous attributes. With feature selection, we are going to create a model with as good or better accuracy while requiring lesser data. Feature selection methods can be used to identify and remove unneeded, irrelevant and redundant attributes from data that do not contribute to the accuracy of a predictive model or may in fact decrease the accuracy of the model.
